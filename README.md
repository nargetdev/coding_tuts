## Some coding tutorials


#### Some basic python logic.

First challenge is to modify a python file to change some functionality.
By default running
`python lesson1.py`

Will output something like this:

```
  x:5 y:5
  000000000000
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  0     +    0
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  000000000000
```

You can move the '+' around by pressing arrow keys.

Look in `lesson1.py` for the following lines.  Put your code in there for now.
```python
    # Add your code here.
    draw(x, y, '+')

    # end user code
```

```
  x:3 y:4
  000000000000
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0...+......0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  000000000000
```
