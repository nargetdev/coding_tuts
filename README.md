## Some coding tutorials


#### Some basic python logic.

First challenge is to modify a python file to change some functionality.
By default running
`python lesson1.py`

Will output something like this:

```
  x:5 y:5
  000000000000
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  0     +    0
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  0          0
  000000000000
```

You can move the '+' around by pressing arrow keys.

Modify the 'Add your code here' bit to make it output this as you move around:

```
  x:3 y:4
  000000000000
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0...+......0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  0   .      0
  000000000000
```
